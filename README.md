npm install

Lift your application 
sails lift
And then go and play with these routes:

http://localhost:1337/post - the very first time it should redirect you to the login page

go to http://localhost:1337/signup for signing up

go to http://localhost:1337/login for logging in

now you should be able to access this page http://localhost:1337/post, even though it's going to show you just an empty array (there aren't any posts yet)

go to http://localhost:1337/logout for logging out
